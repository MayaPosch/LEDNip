	"6 Config File Guidelines
	This chapter is aimed at any user who needs to write a config file, including 
	developers and integrators of OpenOCD and any user who needs to get a new board 
	working smoothly. It provides guidelines for creating those files. "
	
	
JTAG SRST and TRST
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JTAG
	"The TRST pin is an optional active-low reset to the test logic, 
	usually asynchronous, but sometimes synchronous, depending on the chip. If the pin is not available, 
	the test logic can be reset by switching to the reset state synchronously, using TCK and TMS. 
	Note that resetting test logic doesn't necessarily imply resetting anything else. 
	There are generally some processor-specific JTAG operations which can reset all or part 
	of the chip being debugged."

	"JTAG platforms often add signals to the handful defined by the IEEE 1149.1 specification. 
	A System Reset (SRST) signal is quite common, letting debuggers reset the whole system, 
	not just the parts with JTAG support. Sometimes there are event signals used to trigger activity 
	by the host or by the device being monitored through JTAG; or, perhaps, additional control lines."

* meanwhile, looking at the stm32f4x.cfg is enlightening:

	[NOTE] adapter_khz is outside the supported range which has been tested experimentally, so this is flagged for further investigation.
	
http://openocd.org/doc/html/Flash-Commands.html
	Flash Driver: stm32f2x
    All members of the STM32F2, STM32F4 and STM32F7 microcontroller families from 
	STMicroelectronics include internal flash and use ARM Cortex-M3/M4/M7 cores. 
	The driver automatically recognizes a number of these chips using the chip identification 
	register, and autoconfigures itself.

* will have to look up whether reset works with TRST only. 
* Some code snippets and fragments:

http://openocd.org/doc/html/Reset-Configuration.html
	"When SRST is not an option you must set up a reset-assert event 
	handler for your target. For example, some JTAG adapters don’t include the 
	SRST signal; and some boards have multiple targets, and you won’t always 
	want to reset everything at once."

	Software Cold/Warm Reset Generation
	The system module provides the ability to the software to generate an internal cold or warm reset. This is
	accomplished by writing appropriate control bits in the PRCM Reset Control Register (PRM_RSTCTRL).
	Software can utilize this feature to attempt failure recovery. Use of the software cold or warm reset is
	optional."

other example actually toggling pins:
http://www.ethernut.de/pdf/openocd-0.5.0.pdf
	For example, to use pin 6 as SRST (as with an AVR board):
	$_TARGETNAME configure -event reset-assert \
	"usb_blaster pin6 1; wait 1; usb_blaster pin6 0"

http://openocd.org/doc-release/doxygen/cortex__m_8h.html#a672585cafad500ab1872512c00dec3b7

	Referenced by adapter_assert_reset(), and cortex_m_assert_reset().



answer to "why doesn't it work anymore if one follows the config script guidelines and implements -event reset-assert as a mww to AIRCR?":
OpenOCD implements lots of fancy things which can hardly be re-implemented as part of the event handler.

	  969     if (target_has_event_action(target, TARGET_EVENT_RESET_ASSERT)) {
	  970         /* allow scripts to override the reset event */
	  971 
	  972         target_handle_event(target, TARGET_EVENT_RESET_ASSERT);
	  973         register_cache_invalidate(cortex_m->armv7m.arm.core_cache);
	  974         target->state = TARGET_RESET;
	  975 
	  976         return ERROR_OK;
	  977     }
	  978 

and below there is lots of code with what actually has to happen for a reset. 
So essentially - do NOT implement reset-assert event unless you are dealing with an entriely new CPU.

conclusion:

# Assume SRST is unavailable, so we must assert reset ourselves.
$_TARGETNAME configure -event reset-assert "$_TARGETNAME mww phys 0xE000ED0C 0x05FA0004"



turns out, http://openocd.org/doc-release/doxygen/cortex__m_8h.html
